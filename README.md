### Board Setup
Each of the two players has his six pits in front of him. To the right of the six pits, each player has a larger pit. At the start of the game, there are six stones in each of the six round pits .
### Rules
#### Game Play
The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in any of his
own six pits, and sows the stones on to the right, one in each of the following
pits, including his own big pit. No stones are put in the opponents' big pit. If the
player's last stone lands in his own big pit, he gets another turn. This can be
repeated several times before it's the other player's turn.
#### Capturing Stones
During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone
lands in an own empty pit, the player captures his own stone and all stones in the
opposite pit (the other player’s pit) and puts them in his own (big or little?) pit.

#### The Game Ends
The game is over as soon as one of the sides runs out of stones. The player who
still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in his big pit. The winner of
the game is the player who has the most stones in his big pit.
You can also find some visual explanations of the game rules by running a
Google Search for Mancala or Kalaha game.

```

#### Running the application with Executable JAR Windows OS

The code can be built into a jar and then executed/run by using the below commands

```shell
git clone https://github.com/amrkramzy/mancala.git

set DB_JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=DB-secret
java -jar ./target/mancala-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Running the application via docker container

The code can be built into a jar and then executed/run on Docker container by using the below commands

* 	build the jar and Docker image .

```shell
git clone https://github.com/amrkramzy/mancala.git
cd mancala

docker build -t bol-mancala .
docker container run -p 8989:8989 -e DB_JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=DB-secret bol-mancala
```

* 	or run the container from dockerHub image directly.

```shell
docker container run -p 8989:8989 -e DB_JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=DB-secret amrkramzy/bol-mancala
```


#### Running the application via docker-compose 
<div>
<strong style='color:green;'>The recommended</strong> way it to run the docker-compose file which will start the Spring boot application and an angular UI application for demo purpose on the following url : <a href="http://localhost:8585/">angular UI Demo</a>
</div>


```shell
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```
## REST API

This is a simple  documentation for the application REST APIs.<br>
For full APIs documentation please check [Documentation section](#documents) 


## Continuous integration and Continuous delivery
### GitHub action is used here to create 2 workflows

#### Continuous Integration (will be triggered on push and pull requests)
- Build the application and run both unit test and integration test using Maven  
- Apply code analytics with SonarCloud
- Build a docker image and publish it to dockerhub
#### Deploy to Amazon ECS (will be triggered on creating a release )
- Deploy the created DockerHub image to Amazon ECS cluster
